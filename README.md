# Student-marks-prediction-using-Linear-Regression
Using Machine Learning algorithm Linear Regression I have trained a model which predicts the final marks of the student based on the two test grades.

The model name 'lm' can predict the marks of the student based on the two grades of the students. For the visualization Seaborn module has been used. However, the same could have done with Pandas visualization or Matplotlib. 

Regression Evaluation Metrics : 
Here are three common evaluation metrics for regression problems:

1) Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is the mean of the absolute value of the errors:
MAE is the easiest to understand because it's the average error. 

2) Mean Squared Error (MSE) is the mean of the squared errors:
MSE is more popular than MAE because MSE "punishes" larger errors, which tends to be useful in the real world. 

3) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the square root of the mean of the squared errors:
RMSE is even more popular than MSE because RMSE is interpretable in the "y" units. 

All of these are loss functions because we want to minimize them.
